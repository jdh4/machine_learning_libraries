# Spark

## About

Spark is big data processing engine with machine learning functionality. It's greatest utility is that the parallelization is done automatically. The user writes a script and Spark handles the calculations. It offers multiple frontend languages.

Spark 2.2 is available on the HPC clusters. See the [Python API](https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.2.0/api/python/index.html).

Mllib is the old library. The new one which is based on DataFrames is Spark ML.
