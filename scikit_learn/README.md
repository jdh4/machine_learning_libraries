# Scikit-learn

Scikit-learn is a Python library that feature the conventional machine learning models. It sp

+ Conventional models (not a deep learning library)
+ Comfortable to use (elegant ML pipelines)
+ Multithreaded training and limited GPU support (XGB)
+ Excellent documentation (good way to prepare for interviews (ML engineer, data scientist)

For an introduction to machine learning and Scikit-learn see this GitHub [repo and book](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2) by Aurelien Geron.
